# Mitochondria
### Goal: 
AI Informed, Free-to-Consume, High Quality Education.

If the government can print money to bail out banks, 
then we can print money to create high quality education.

# Mitochondria Tokenomics
This project is powered by $MITY, an ERC20 token.

On launch, a $MITY can be purchased for 0.03089294 ETH, where it stays in your wallet.

The goal is for 1 $MITY to be worth a daily living wage in most parts of the United States.

After launch, its value will be driven by:
1) The perceived quality and impact of the educational resources it supports
2) Its utility within the platform
3) The growth of the Mitochondria ecosystem

For every $MITY minted through labor, the DAO takes on 20% of that debt.

If a $MITY is not minted through labor, it is subject to a 3% purchasers fee which goes to managing that debt.

Given that the token is backed by education, use of the education, and demand for the education, the value trajectory is positive.

# Quality Assurance
There is no desire for individuals who can spit out definitions on demand.

Memorizing information does not mean you know how to use it, or advance it.

### FAFO Education Model
I propose a new learning model based on how information is actually discovered:

Experience (problem identified) > Philosophy (what is the nature of the problem?) > Theory (here's how I would go about solving it) > Implementation (the empirical nitty-gritty) > Experience (restart cycle).

This provides a framework for education that is not just about what to learn, but how to learn and how to think. 

It instills skills that are essential for navigating a complex and ever-changing world.

It removes dependence on AI to solve the problems, and instead leaves AI to hammer out implementation of the devised solutions.

### If your course can teach me the philosophy and how that translates into theory and then implementation, *that* is high quality education.

# Bounties
A Bounty is created when a proposal for a new education domain is submitted and then verified by the DAO.

The bounty is equal to 25% of the staked tokens, and is paid out over the creation of the curriculum, milestone based.

The staking member is purchasing Vote tokens from the DAO with that 25%, those are used later.

The Bounty outlines what knowledge gaps the curriculum needs to teach, the DAO defines milestones and verifies the completions are of Quality.

Bounties are managed by the DAO, and the DAO is human so this takes time.

### Milestones

### The Sections of the Cirriculum:
The Problem
The Philosophy behind solving it well
The Theories based on the different philosophies
The Current Implementation
Student Projects proving Quality of Education

Each section can have multiple chapters, but each one must be outlined.
Bam, all your milestones. Just like per chapter payments.

### Implementation Plan
Submitted to a Bounty, it outlines a proposed curriculum and how it will be taught.

When the first Implementation Plan is submitted, there is a 30 day period to allow for competing Implementations to emerge.

After the 30 days, the Implementation plan with the most votes by staked token holders receives the bounty.

Only those who care and are informed enough will vote, but everyone *can* vote.

## How do I get paid though
### Initial Funding
Milestones are determined in your curriculum creation, and you are paid per milestone.

This means we need an Empirical standard of quality for education, which I have yet to define. Perhaps based on depth, ease of consumption, and quality of production. But that's not empirical.

Ideally if you do even better, the DAO tips you through minted coin.

The bounty is spread evenly across all milestones, as long as they are of Quality.

### Kickbacks
After the curriculum is published, token holders can access it, and earn a soulbound certification that says "this wallet completed a course by this educator" upon completion.

Whenever a bounty is completed by a student inside that domain (took an agriculture course, completed a bounty for building a planting bed), the Teacher gets a kickback (10% of the Bounty's worth is minted into their wallet).

I would also like them to be paid based on how well their students interact with tests (standardized testing, but like projects, not tests).

Student project grades will be based on: understanding of how to tackle the problem, flexibility in doing so, and effectiveness of the solution.

# Governance cycle:
1) A gap in education is identified
2) Token holder initiates proposal
3) DAO leadership works with Proposer to define milestones and goals
4) Verified Bounty posted
5) Implementation Plans submitted
6) Token holders staked in this Bounty vote on the one that aligns the best with the proposal
7) Winner builds the content, sustaining themselves on bounty payments
8) Students learn and complete the curriculum

### Pro-Whale
We love whales, they fund our projects, but we don't love it when they absorb a lot of power.

What I propose is the Elite Lie, which essentially hammers out a path to becoming a symbolic monarch.

You get your name on the project, you can show it off, no one needs to know that all you did was fund it.

Cosmetic Influence.

### Writing on the Wall
If you can see that the DAO is starting to kinda tank, there is absolutely no shame in trading your tokens in for another currency. It is your crypto after all.

# STAGE 2
Now that there is a platform where token holders can propose bounties, AND there are highly educated individuals inside the network, we now have a Radiative Distributed Specialization of individuals (since everyone is specialized in their own thing, the collective is generalist).

I think something like that can achieve Solarpunk, given enough time, resources.
