# Goal:
Divine a conceptual model that maps 100% to reality

## 1) Alignment
The collective goals and the individual's needs form an alignment, and that starts a cycle.
For example, you don't want to be homeless, so you get a job that ideally pays you enough money.

## 2) Cooperation
An agreement is made, an equivalent exchange between the two parties.
For example, your boss agrees to pay you money for you to work for him.

## 3) Individual performs Work
Real Work creats a product or performs a service.
For example, you took orders at a drive-through.

## 4) Individual Compensation
Real Work is rewarded with compensation.
For example, you get paid two weeks later.

Then, we go back to step 1. Are the collective goals and the individual's needs still in alignment?
For example, are you not getting paid enough?
Then it's time for something new.

Suggested model:
## 1) Invitation
The collective lists tasks that need to be completed for a pre-determined amount.

## 2) Individual Performs Work

## 3) Collective Compensates Individual

## 4) Collective Sells or Utilizes Product or Service

done.

This is terrible I must sleep on this.
Government by bounty? How do I assign them? Or is it just like it's there you better hurry your dumbass up.
Compensate the less desirable tasks more. Like a disgusting tax from the indidivudal. ok I'm too high good night.
