# Goal:
Define a Cybersyn governance model that runs as a parallel mutual aid network

So far, I’ve identified that “alignment” of goals between the government and the governed starts a governance cycle. The alignment is established by an equivalent exchange between the parties, creating “cooperation” where the two parties engage in that equivalent exchange (I Work, you compensate me), leading to the “result” (finished Work). If both parties are satisfied with the result, then the alignment is confirmed and the cycle goes again.

Some things to note, human parties’ identities (and therefore motivations, resources, and expression) will change over time.
If the party is non-human (egregoroc or cybersyn), its identity isn’t subject to change by Time, but by the mythology that defines the society, and by the programmers who change the code to reflect it.

The tension of the synergetic exchange maintains the system.

I'm picturing a model where the governing party creates bounties. They can be assigned, or up for grabs. Policy, farm work, construction, research, anything that involves collective effort for the benefit of the individual, where those motivations do not align automatically.
Ideally, the government's bank account is publically viewable on-chain, so they cannot easily scam you.

Assume the governance is a non-human cybersyn entity.

## Alignment:
"I have this specific Work, I need Labor, I'll pay you to do the work." - governance
"ok." or "nah fam, [reason optional]" - governed

## Equivalent Exchange:
"I have done the work." - governed
"ok cool here's the $10 we agreed upon." - governance

## Result:
The governance can be pleased or not about the product
The governed can be pleased or not about the compensation

Depending on the result, if the goals are still aligned, the cycle continues. If not, an investigation is conducted to identify a more even compromise.

Democratizing policy-making education will help the boots on the ground understand how to shape the system in alignment with the collective's goals.
