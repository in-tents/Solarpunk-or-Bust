# Goal:
Divine a conceptual model that maps 100% to reality

So far, I’ve identified that “alignment” of goals between the government and the governed starts a governance cycle. The alignment is established by an equivalent exchange between the parties, creating “cooperation” where the two parties engage in that equivalent exchange (I provide, you compensate me), leading to the “result”. If both parties are satisfied with the result, then the alignment is confirmed and the cycle goes again.

Some things to note, governed parties’ identities (and therefore motivations, resources, and expression) will change over time.
If the party is non-human (egregoroc or cybersyn), its identity isn’t subject to change by time, but it is changeable by the parts inside the whole.

The tension of the synergetic exchange maintains the system.
