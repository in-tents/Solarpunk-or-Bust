## $CTYL
Crystals are worth [$50 USD on August 8th, 2025]. If you want one, that's how much you have to pay.

## Work
Work is made available by bounty. They can be claimed, assigned (for specialists), or competitions (first one or best one).

The DAO can only create bounties that forge crystal if the Work requires more than one individual's effort and directly or indirectly benefits a minimum of 50% the members.

Compensation is pre-determined per task by the AGI in regards to current policy.

Upon accepting a bounty, you are paid 1/2 of the bounty.
When the bounty is verified, you are paid the rest of it.
If you went the extra mile, you are compensated based on multipliers in pre-determined categories.
Unfortunately I am not sure how to quantify art, but art is desirable.

If you fudge the bounty, meaning you took it but did not complete it, you will have to pay off the 1/2 payment across your next bounties.
If you don't complete the bounty to specifications, you must try again until you provide an acceptable product. If you decline to finish, that is considered fudging.

The DAO takes on 20% of the forged crystal on as debt, so that we do not idly shit money into existence. We must burn $CTYL periodically to keep this number in check.
