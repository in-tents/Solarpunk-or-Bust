# Goal: 
Fund construction of sustainable gardens attached to food banks that already serve meals. The bottom line is food is a human right, but we must work to keep it so. 
# This is a non-profit crypto project, this is not where you make your millions.

Workers earn $CTYL through pre-defined, productive work (when an action is claimable and completed, it is recorded, and they are compensated for it).
The goal is to raise the bar for the general welfare. Not a way to be rich, a way to not starve to death. Only 14% of the population, only one basic need.

$CTYL costs [$50 USD on August 8th, 2026]. If you want one, you must trade that much in value for one.
There is a 10% purchasers fee, which goes towards debt and ideally funding gardens, and 10% of that 10% goes to the founder's salary, capped at 1,500 $CTYL per year, beginning August 2025 and ending August 2028.

## Proposals
Crystal holders above a to-be-determined threshold can submit proposals for new community gardens. The DAO cannot go into debt to build these, unfortunately, I cannot have thousands of abandoned projects because the DAO crashes.
