# Goal: 
Fund construction of sustainable gardens attached to food banks that already serve meals. The bottom line is food is a human right, but we must work to keep it so. 
# This is a non-profit crypto project, this is not where you make your millions.

Workers forge (mint) $CTYL through pre-defined, productive work (when an action is claimable and completed, it is recorded, and they are compensated for it).
Workers are also "paid" in three meals from the kitchens.
The goal is to raise the bar for the general welfare. Not a way to be rich, a way to not starve to death. Only 14% of the population, only one basic need.

$CTYL costs ($50 USD on August 8th, 2026), which is supposed to represent a living wage after living expenses, which ideally the community scales to *sustainably* meet (food, water, shelter, electricity, education, healthcare).
There is a 10% purchasers fee, which goes towards debt and ideally funding gardens, and 10% of that 10% goes to the founder's salary, capped at 1,500 $CTYL per year, beginning August 2025 and ending August 2028.
## Forging
A $CTYL is supposed to act as a standard living daily wage. Farms, for example, require daily maintenance. Each task is assigned a $CTYL value by the DAO's Cybersyn (ideally the daily work amounts to a single $CTYL but sometimes there is a lot of work, and workers should be compensated). This places the burden of proof-of-work on the employer, since he should not ask an employee to do something for nothing.

The DAO takes on 20% of the minted coin as debt, so that we do not idly shit money. We must burn $CTYL periodically to keep this number in check.
## Value
As your profession produces goods, Catalyst will purchase them from you, and then sell them to a buyer or use them throughout the network. The DAO will tank this debt, but recoup it from buyers in- and out-of-network.
But, as you get better at your artform (planting, pottery, baking), the DAO can sell your artisanal goods for more money. The DAO is non-profit, all extra money it makes from quality markups goes back to you. The money you make from selling these goods depends on the need for the item, it's a flexible creature. Sometimes we need potatoes, other times we need leafy greens. Someone will find a way to abuse it, but as a policymaker I will find it and devise a solution. Cybersyn keeps track of demand for products across the network and sets the prices.
## Proposals
Crystal holders above a to-be-determined threshold can submit proposals for new community gardens. The DAO cannot go into debt to build these, unfortunately, I cannot have thousands of abandoned projects because the DAO crashes.
