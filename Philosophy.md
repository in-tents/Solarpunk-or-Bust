Not rejection of materialism, but removing it as the north star

I am unsure if philosphy should be so rigidly defined.

The problem with philosopher kings is that the ones that WANT to be king are aligned with their own interests, and not with those they would rule.

Through Plato's lens:
Problem (this form is imperfect) -> Philosophy (what IS the ideal form?) -> Theory (the ideal form) -> Implementation (the iterated form) -> Experience (i guess this is ok)
